# Deeplinker

A CLI tool, and maybe a library, to use applescript to detect frontmost app in MacOS, a deeplink to its current state, and some descriptive context for the current state.

The goal is a utility for quickly capturing a linkl to current place for notes, reminders, and things like that.

## Status

Proof of concept, playing around with approaches. Not actually very useful... yet :-)

Eventually will provide an easy mechanism to add support for different scriptable apps (hence making it OSS, and keeping it really simple.

Currently in rust, because I like rust. May switch to swift if rust starts getting in the way as it is a more natural language for this tool.
